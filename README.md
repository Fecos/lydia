lydia
=====

Android front end for in car use.  Currently it will only work properly on a Nexus 7 tablet because of hardcoded settings.  

"lydia" is the table portion.
"lydia_phone" is the phone portion.  

Between the two of them there is bluetooth support for sending/receiving SMS's, media and volume control, with more to come in the future.
